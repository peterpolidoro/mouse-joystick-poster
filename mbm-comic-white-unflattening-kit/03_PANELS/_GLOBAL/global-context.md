# GLOBAL CONTEXT (upload or paste into every panel-generation chat)

## Poster story
“Science with Mechatronics: **power + information → datasets → papers**.”
The panels zoom inward through nested boundaries (system → rig → PCB → firmware → actuator → theory).

## MBM grammar (fixed)
- Boundaries are translucent spherical bubbles.
- **Power** crossings: thick amber arrows/ribbons.
- **Information** crossings: thin cyan arrows/fibers.
- Optionally show dissipation/entropy as a subtle red haze/flow.
- Artifacts (datasets/figures/papers) are physical objects (glass cards, data crystals).

## Style
- White background / light paper feel, suitable for printing.
- Semi-realistic 3D, cinematic lighting, soft shadow, mild ink outline.
- Avoid block-diagram / powerpoint look.
- Minimal embedded text.
