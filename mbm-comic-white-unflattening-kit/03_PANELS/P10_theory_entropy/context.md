# P10 — Theory epilogue: power–information–entropy

## 1) Goal (viewer takeaway)
One strong visual sentence: **Wide abstract scene: power stream + info stream + entropy export; ties loop to artifacts; minimal words.**

## 2) Must-use global grammar (do not change)
- Boundary = translucent spherical bubble(s)
- Information = cyan (#06B6D4) thin arrows/fibers
- Power = amber (#F59E0B) thick ribbons/tubes
- Optional dissipation = muted red (#DC2626) haze/flow
- Artifacts = physical objects (glass cards / data crystals)

## 3) Composition notes
- White / paper-friendly background (match #FFFFFF or very light #F7F7F7).
- Semi-realistic 3D, mild perspective, soft shadows, slight ink-outline OK.
- Keep **text minimal** (prefer icons). No big paragraphs.
- Leave ~3–5% safe margin so clipping won’t cut key elements.

## 4) Assets to upload in this chat (you provide)
**Required**
- (A) `03_PANELS/_GLOBAL/global-context.md`
- (B) This `context.md`

**Panel-specific (add as available)**
- Reference images you want included (photos, screenshots, CAD renders).
- Any figure crops / dataset examples relevant to this panel.

**Nice-to-have**
- `00_ADMIN/style-bible-white.md`
- `02_ASSETS/style/palette-white.svg`
- `02_ASSETS/style/arrow-grammar.svg`

## 5) Output spec (ask the model for this)
- Output: PNG
- Size target: ~43.5×5.5 in equivalent framing
- Pixels (recommended @300 dpi): 13050×1650px
- Background: transparent if possible; otherwise pure white.

## 6) Prompt block you can paste into the panel chat
> Create a single comic panel illustration for a 48×48 inch poster printed on white paper. The panel must feel like semi-realistic 3D illustration with depth and soft shadows, not a flat block diagram. Use translucent spherical boundary bubbles, with crossings shown as: information = thin cyan fiber arrows (#06B6D4) and power = thick amber ribbon/tube arrows (#F59E0B). Optionally show dissipation as subtle red haze (#DC2626). Keep text minimal. Wide abstract scene: power stream + info stream + entropy export; ties loop to artifacts; minimal words. White background or transparent. Compose with clear focal object and leave safe margins for clipping.

## 7) Don’ts (negative constraints)
- No PowerPoint look, no flat UML/SysML block diagram look.
- No dense text. No tiny labels everywhere.
- Avoid noisy backgrounds; keep print-friendly contrast.
