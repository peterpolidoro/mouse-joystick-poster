# Style Bible — MBM Comic Poster (White Paper + Metallic Boundary Edition)

This poster is a **graphic‑novel page** about:

**Science with Mechatronics: _power + information → datasets → papers_.**

Your visual language must stay consistent across 10 separately generated panels.

---

## 0) Print intent (white paper)

- Final print is on **white paper**. Treat the *page* as white (#FFFFFF).
- Use **very light gray** as “gutter air” if needed (suggested #F3F4F6 to #F8FAFC).
- Avoid big dark fills (ink-heavy). Prefer: outlines, soft shadows, subtle gradients.

---

## 1) MBM diagram grammar (do not change meaning midstream)

MBM is a hierarchical boundary/port model: draw a boundary around an entity, then show **what crosses** that boundary as **power** and/or **information**.

**Boundary**
- Visual metaphor: **3D brushed‑nickel “armillary sphere”** (several intersecting metal rings forming a sphere).
- Purpose: clearly says “this is a chosen abstraction cut” while still letting the viewer see what’s inside.

**Ports**
- Where arrows attach, show a small **metal collar / grommet** on the sphere (like a port fitting).

**Flows**
- **Information flow**: thin 3D arrow/tube, *metallic body* with **cyan accent** (anodized strip or edge glow).
- **Power flow**: thicker 3D arrow/tube, *metallic body* with **amber accent** (copper/brass feel or warm glow).
- A single port can carry both (allowed), but keep power vs info visually distinct.

**Artifacts**
- Datasets, figures, configs, etc. appear as **physical objects**: glass cards, acrylic slabs, “data crystals,” or stacked file blocks.

**Optional (Panel 10 / theory)**
- Dissipation / entropy export: faint heat shimmer, subtle red haze, or tiny drifting particles — always secondary to power/info arrows.

## 2) Materials + finish (signature look)

### 2.1 Boundary spheres (brushed nickel)
- Brushed nickel / stainless appearance:
  - soft anisotropic highlights (brushed direction visible)
  - slightly warm gray metal
  - clean specular edges
- Avoid “soap bubble rainbow” look.

### 2.2 Arrow bodies (metallic)
- Arrows should look like **real 3D objects in space**:
  - extruded tube/beam with an arrowhead (or tapered end)
  - soft reflections + shadow on nearby objects
- Encode meaning using:
  - **anodized accent strip** along the arrow (best for print)
  - or a subtle **edge glow** (don’t overdo bloom)

### 2.3 Suggested palette (accents)
- Info accent: **cyan** #06B6D4
- Power accent: **amber** #F59E0B
- Dissipation accent (optional): **muted red** #DC2626
- Ink/outline: near‑black #111827
- Gutter air: #F3F4F6 – #F8FAFC

## 3) Rendering style (avoid block diagrams)

- Semi‑realistic 3D with:
  - perspective depth
  - rim light / key light
  - soft ambient occlusion
- Mild “ink line” is OK, but **do not** flatten into a schematic.
- Use **big shapes**; few arrows; strong silhouettes.

---

## 4) Composition rules (poster readability)

- One clear focal object per panel (paper, dataset constellation, rig, PCB, MCU, motor, etc.).
- Prefer 1–5 arrows per panel (rarely more than 7).
- Keep **text minimal** inside the generated panel image:
  - 0–2 tiny labels max (icons preferred)
  - Add longer labels later in Inkscape.

---

## 5) Continuity across panels

- The “camera” can change, but keep:
  - consistent materials (nickel boundaries, metallic arrows)
  - consistent accent colors (cyan info, amber power)
  - consistent artifact style (glass/data objects)
- Suggest transitions by letting a flow arrow **aim toward the panel edge** that leads to the next panel.
