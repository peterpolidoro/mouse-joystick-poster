# Style Bible — MBM Comic Poster (White Paper Edition)

This poster is a *graphic-novel page* about “Science with Mechatronics: power + information → datasets → papers”.
Keep the visuals **3D, physical, and cinematic**, but keep the *grammar* consistent.

## Background + print intent
- The poster is printed on **white paper**. The base page is **white (#FFFFFF)**.
- Gutters and non-panel background should be a *very light* tint (recommended **#F3F4F6**) so panels read as windows.
- Avoid large dark fills that drink ink; use outlines, soft shadows, and selective color instead.

## MBM grammar (never change meaning midstream)
- **Boundary**: translucent spherical “bubble” around an entity; nested bubbles allowed.
- **Information flow**: **cyan** (suggested #06B6D4), **thin**, fiber-optic look (packets/dots OK).
- **Power flow**: **amber** (suggested #F59E0B), **thicker**, energetic ribbon/tube look.
- **Optional dissipation / entropy export**: **muted red** (#DC2626) as haze or dashed smoky flow.
- **Artifacts** (datasets/figures/paper): depicted as physicalized “glass cards” or “data crystals”.

## Rendering style
- Semi-realistic 3D with depth, rim light, and soft shadow.
- Slight hand-ink outline is OK, but avoid flat block-diagram aesthetics.
- Minimal text inside panels; add captions/labels in Inkscape when possible.

## Composition rules
- Keep a clear focal object per panel (paper, dataset cluster, rig, PCB, MCU, motor, etc.).
- Use a consistent camera language: mild perspective, not orthographic.
- Leave ~3–5% safe margin inside each panel mask so clipping doesn’t cut important content.

## Color + materials
- Page: white; gutters: very light gray.
- Frames/ink: near-black (#111827).
- Bubbles: glassy with cool highlights (subtle cyan edge).
- Hardware: metals + PCB greens + neutral plastics.

## Readability at poster distance
- Prefer **big shapes** + **few arrows** over dense labeling.
- Any numbers/variables should be “icon sized” and optional.
