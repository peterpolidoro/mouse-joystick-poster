#+title: mouse-joystick-poster
#+options: toc:2 num:nil

* Overview

This repository is the working directory for a scientific/engineering poster about a
mouse pull joystick rig and its *Mechatronic Boundary Model (MBM)* framing.

The goal is to keep the *toolchain reproducible* (CAD → render → layout) using
GNU Guix, while keeping the poster *portable* between:

- a traditional printed poster (up to 45×45 in), and
- an iPoster-style digital poster (55" touch screen), without depending on proprietary tools.

* Repository layout

This is a suggested structure. Use what fits your workflow.

- =cad/= :: STEP files and derived CAD assets
  - =cad/joystick/= :: joystick assembly STEP, subparts, notes
  - =cad/pcb/= :: pcb assembly STEP, subparts, notes
- =kicad/= :: KiCad project(s)
- =freecad/= :: FreeCAD project(s) used to explode/arrange STEP assemblies
- =blender/= :: Blender scene(s) used to render poster-quality images
- =poster/= :: Inkscape (SVG) source poster layouts
- =output/renders/= :: rendered images (PNG, EXR, etc.)
- =output/exports/= :: exported PDFs / final deliverables (print + iPoster)
- =docs/= :: extra notes, references, meeting notes, etc.

* Reproducible environment (Guix)

** Prerequisite

Install GNU Guix on your machine (system install or in userland).

** Enter the development environment

From the repo root:

#+begin_src sh
make shell
#+end_src

This opens a shell with the full toolchain available:

- =kicad=
- =freecad=
- =blender=
- =inkscape=
- =gimp=

Exit the shell to return to your normal environment.

** Pure shell (more reproducible)

#+begin_src sh
make shell-pure
#+end_src

If GUI apps have issues in the pure shell (fonts, locales, etc.), see *Troubleshooting*.

** Pinning =channels.scm= (important)

To make the environment *fully reproducible* for collaborators and for your future self,
pin Guix to an exact revision:

#+begin_src sh
make lock-channels
git add guix/channels.scm
git commit -m "Pin Guix channel revision"
#+end_src

Once pinned, *everyone* can reproduce the same environment using:

#+begin_src sh
make shell
#+end_src

because =guix time-machine= will use the exact commit recorded in =guix/channels.scm=.

* Workflow sketch (CAD → render → layout)

This is a practical pipeline that keeps assets editable and poster-friendly.

** 1) CAD / EDA: produce STEP assemblies

- Joystick assembly: place in =cad/joystick/=
- PCB assembly:
  - create in KiCad
  - export 3D / STEP (as needed)
  - place in =cad/pcb/=

** 2) FreeCAD: explode & stage views

Use FreeCAD to:

- import STEP assemblies
- create an *exploded* configuration
- set up repeatable camera/view directions (orthographic is often best for posters)
- export meshes if you plan to render in Blender

Output examples:
- a “technical” orthographic view (good for labels/callouts)
- a slightly more dynamic view to use as a hero image

Save FreeCAD project files in =freecad/=.

** 3) Blender: poster-quality renders

Use Blender to render:

- high-resolution PNG (often with transparent background) for overlaying labels
- optionally a “hero” render with nicer lighting/shadows for visual impact

Save Blender files in =blender/= and rendered images in =output/renders/=.

** 4) Layout: Inkscape (SVG source of truth)

Keep the poster layout in SVG so you can export to:

- print PDF (square format; up to 45×45 in)
- iPoster PDF (often 16:9 landscape)

Suggested approach:
- =poster/print.svg=
- =poster/iposter.svg=

Exports go in =output/exports/=.

* iPoster vs print notes

You can avoid lock-in by maintaining the *same content assets* (renders, diagrams, plots)
and exporting two layouts.

For iPoster, you can add optional interaction (embedded links, QR codes, page navigation),
but try to keep the core narrative readable in a static export.

* Troubleshooting

** Fonts missing in pure shell

If text renders oddly in Inkscape/GIMP/Blender, confirm fonts are present in the shell:

#+begin_src sh
fc-list | head
#+end_src

This manifest includes a baseline set of fonts and =fontconfig=.

** Locales

If you see locale warnings, you may need:

#+begin_src sh
export GUIX_LOCPATH="$HOME/.guix-profile/lib/locale"
#+end_src

(Or consider using =make shell= instead of =make shell-pure=.)

* License

Add a license if/when you intend to publish/distribute the design files.
