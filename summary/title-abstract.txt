Science with Mechatronics: power and information -> datasets -> papers

Modern neuroscience depends on custom experimental rigs. This poster targets neuroscience collaborations between scientists and engineers by presenting a mouse pull joystick rig as a case study in Science with Mechatronics: designing the entire stack (mechanics, transducers, power electronics, real-time firmware, and host protocols) as a single precision instrument. The rig positions and loads a joystick with motorized actuation and braking, measures pull kinematics and force/torque, and logs time-aligned events to produce trial-structured, analysis-ready datasets. We highlight two practices that make the pipeline robust and maintainable: (1) the Mechatronic Boundary Model (MBM), which makes boundary crossings explicit as power or information ports and treats datasets/figures as first-class outputs; and (2) event-driven firmware built on QP actors and hierarchical state machines to enforce deterministic timing, explicit safety handling, and clear experiment orchestration. By automating experimental tedium and making artifacts and interfaces explicit, mechatronics helps scientists move from transducers to publishable figures, and ultimately papers, faster. The same approach generalizes to other behavioral rigs.
